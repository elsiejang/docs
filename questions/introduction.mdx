Questions are the primary output and core purpose of Semilattice, delivering information gain over the status quo.
## What is a Question?
A Question is a prediction of how a specific group of people, modeled as a Population, would respond to a single option multiple-choice question in aggregate. The result of a Question is a distribution of people over the different answer options, e.g. 65% say "Yes" and 35% say "No".

The term "question" is used in various contexts to mean slightly different things in the context of Semilattice. Let's break these down.
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Question">
        "Question" with a capitalised "Q", means the Question feature. The Question feature lets you create predictions of how Populations would answer questions, lowercase "q": the actual open-ended propositions to which you seek answers.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="question">
        A "question" with a lowercase "q" means what "question" generally means: "a sentence worded or expressed so as to elicit information.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Target question">
        A "target question" refers to a question which is being predicted. Describing it as a "target" question emphasises that its answer is unknown and the goal is to predict it accurately.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Ground truth or seed data question">
        "Ground truth questions" or "seed data questions" refer to the question data used to create (and test) Populations. The term "question" is often used in the context of a Population's seed data or ground truth to mean both the question itself (e.g. "What is your age?") and its set of answers (e.g. ["21-25", "26-30", "21-25", "41-45", etc.]) from the target population.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Test question">
        A "test question" is a ground truth or seed data question against which the Population has been tested. Since Semilattice tests Populations against their seed data, once a Population has been tested all its seed data questions are also test questions.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
## Single option multiple-choice questions
Semilattice only accepts as input and only produces as output single option multiple-choice questions. This means a question to which there is a finite set of answer options of which the respondent can only choose one as their answer. For example:
> To what degree do you believe reality is a computer simulation?
> A) Definitely not a simulation
> B) Probably not a simulation
> C) Unsure / No opinion
> D) Possibly a simulation
> E) Very likely a simulation
We have plans to expand the types of questions we support in the near future.
